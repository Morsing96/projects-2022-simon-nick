**Results:** In this assignment, we will look at an insurance company that, using numerical analysis, will maximize its profit, respectively, while we also see it from an agent's point of view, which will also maximize its utility. The results of the project can se seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).
